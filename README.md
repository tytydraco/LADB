# LunarixusADB
## A local ADB shell for Android, sponsored by the Lunarixus brand.

# How does it work?
It doesn't.

# Initial Setup:
Open the app.

# Troubleshooting:
You don't.

Still not working? Try this:
- Fucking yourself.

# Credit
Thanks to that one guy for precompiling ADB for the ARM/ARM64 architecture.

# License
While this project is GPLv3 licensed, I would like to add an additional parameter: no recompilations of the app are to be placed on the Google Play Store or any alternative APK-providing websites.

Still confused? Okay.
